# DH100
This is my repository for DH 100 at Cal with Adam Anderson.

Here I will post my project from the course and include my datasets and notebooks.

My collaborator is @admndrsn

Here's a link to my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jgsmUR4yCB4RBCzMGY6YsVVaLeAhimTI?usp=sharing

## GitHub contents:

  ### Datasets:
  
   Here are all my datasets. Some are split by year. They include crime information, arrest information, DA information, and homicide rates for the top 29 US cities for 2020 and 2019. All files are described in my notebook. Some files, including data for police calls and arrests were too large to uload to github.
      
 ### Notebooks:
   
    I only have one notebook for my project, but it will be stored here.
    
 ### Storyboards
   
    Here will be interations of my storyboards by week
    
 ### Misc/visualizations.
    
    I plan to keep miscellaneous files and datavisualizations from other programs or apps in this file.
    
## Abstract
   How Policing and Crime are Changing in San Francisco: What The Data Says

	The role of police in America has come under intense scrutiny over the past year. With the protests that erupted throughout the country last summer over the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breona Taylor, and too many others, many questions have been raised about how police officers should function in society. What constitutes a crime? Who are the police more likely to arrest? Are police officers the best choice to respond to certain situations? How are police officers held accountable? I want to explore these questions and more, investigating the stories that publicly available data can tell us about policing in my own city: San Francisco. I’m particularly interested in what the data can tell us from the past few years. Our recently appointed district attorney, Chesa Boudin, has come under fire from critics online for what they claim is his “too soft on crime” attitude. As a candidate in 2019, he ran on a progressive platform promoting restorative justice and promising accountability for police officers who overstep their duties. Critics claim that under Boudin crime has skyrocketed in San Francisco and the city has become lawless, but I want to see what the actual data says. 
	My research question would then be: how have policing and crime changed in San Francisco since Chesa Boudin became district attorney and what can be attributed to his policies? It’s easy to get caught up in heated online debates over public policy, but strong accusations must be supported with strong evidence. As someone who has followed the debate over policing closely the past few years and as a politically active resident of San Francisco, I want to get a clearer picture of how my city functions as well. I will be using publicly available data from San Francisco’s online databases of police incident reports, arrest rates, incarceration rates, and police misconduct reports over time. I will also look at the demographics of those involved and compare those with the demographics of San Francisco at large and look for discrepancies. In addition, I will look at when specific public safety policies in San Francisco were implemented and see if trends changed afterwards. There have already been many studies conducted on crime and policing in San Francisco, but none that I’m aware of on the policies of our district attorney Chesa Boudin in particular. 
	With such a broad topic of crime and policing, it’s important not to be too hasty in attributing causation to certain trends. While correlations in policy and crime data may come up, I will need to look at other factors that may have contributed to changes. For example, the election of Boudin was followed shortly after by the Coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis which surely had massive effects on crime and policing in San Francisco. Due to the short nature of this course I must limit the scope of my project and cannot explore much larger ideas about what causes crime, but will simply see if the data backs up the claims of Boudin’s critics. In particular these three topics: Has violent crime risen disproportionately in San Francisco compared to other cities? Are police officers disproportionately arresting and using force on people of color? And, are fewer arrests being pursued with charges by our current district attorney’s office compared to previous DA’s? I plan to compare San Francisco’s crime reports with those of other cities with similarly progressive district attorneys, as well as cities with more conservative DA’s. If crime in other cities follows similar trends as San Francisco, that may suggest influencing factors larger than one district attorney. 
	To find these trends, I plan to use mainly line graphs to chart rates of crime, arrests, bookings, convictions, police use of force reports, police misconduct reports, and police firearm discharge reports over time. Most of the relevant data is available on SF.gov in accessible .csv files, so accessing data in a Jupyter notebook should not be too difficult. For comparisons with other cities I will keep my data limited to simple crime rates by category (violent crime, petty theft, burglary, etc.). I expect the data will confirm my suspicion that Boudin’s critics’ claims are unfounded. I expect that crime trends in San Francisco will reflect larger trends in other cities. I expect that police in San Francisco are in fact disproportionately arresting and using force on people of color and I expect that the DA’s office is pursuing charges at similar rates to previous DAs. 
	I will use critical theory when pursuing my research question. I want to challenge assumptions about the role of police in our society and look at how public policy affects the lives of San Francisco’s residents. Looking into what is and what isn’t considered a crime and how that changes over time is also important to my project. For example, public policy in San Francisco concerning drug use has changed over time. Marijuana has recently been legalized and policy has shifted from punishing drug users and those addicted to drugs to guiding them towards treatment. This project will shed a little light on the effects of policing and public policy in San Francisco and will contribute to the ongoing conversation on policing in America. This project will also hopefully make me and my fellow classmates more informed citizens. It will help make me a more informed resident of San Francisco and may allow me to make more informed decisions in my voting and interactions with police moving forward.
	This project is only a tiny piece of the vast mosaic of research being done on policing. I plan to accompany my data with scholarly research on critical race theory, public policy, crime and punishment, and local politics. Hopefully I can contribute to the discussion in some small way.
